It is unfortunate that the website is not currently live right now due to few of its functionalities not working. 
You still have major part of the code that you can go through and get an idea of the UI as well as backend connection with Appwrite, Plaid, Sentry and Dwolla.

Thank you for your patience.

Currently debugging the code , 

Recently , there were a few changes to the Appwrite(server error for the free version) and Plaid sand-box environment 
and the previous code is having errors pulling up the transactions summary. 

The website will be up as soon as possible !
